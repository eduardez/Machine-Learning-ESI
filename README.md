## Predicting the spread of Dengue from climate data

### Objetive
Dengue has emerged as one of the major epidemics in current times. There is some evidence available about the correlation of this disease with climate. If we are able to model the number of cases reported historically in a place using the climate data for that place over the same period, It shall increase our accuracy in predicting the spread of this disease. Which in turn shall help not only in being better prepared in our efforts at the individual level but also at the government level for prevention as well as treatment measures.

### Data
The data has been obtained from [drivenData.org](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/), it was released as a part of their competition DengAI. In their own words, driven data hosts "data science competitions to save the world"..

### Modelling Approaches
A quick walk-through of different modeling techniques used:

1. Negative_Binomial_Regression
2. Random_Forest
  
>In our case, the best model is....
